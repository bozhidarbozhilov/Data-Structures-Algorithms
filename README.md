# Data-Structures-Algorithms

counting and radix sort - have to know what is the sorted data
and make some assumptions for it. Used for positive integers data structures.\
stable sort algorithm - preserve relative order of 
equal elements in the given data structure.\
unstable sort algorithm - does not guarantee relative order 
of equal elements will be preserved after sorting
